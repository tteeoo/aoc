# Advent of Code

My solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

Mainly done in Python. The code is dedicated to the public domain ([The Unlicense](https://github.com/tteeoo/aoc/blob/main/LICENSE)).

These are by no means the most effecient program for each problem, nor are they coded neatlyâ€”they're not meant to be; the code here is just what I develop on the spot, implementing whatever algorithm pops into my head first (easy ones, not good ones).
