# Advent of Code

My solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

Right now I'm mainly using Python. The code is dedicated to the public domain ([The Unlicense](https://github.com/tteeoo/aoc/blob/main/LICENSE)).

Disclaimer: these are no where near the most effecient program for each problemâ€”and they're not meant to be; the code here is just what I develop on the spot when doing the puzzles, implementing whatever algorithm pops into my head first (easy ones, not good ones).
